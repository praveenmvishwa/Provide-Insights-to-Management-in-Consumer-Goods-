# Probleam statment
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.
 
# Project Details
This is a project I have done as part of Codebasics SQL Project Challenge. Following are the key highlights of this project:

1. SQL - I have used SQL to query the database. Applied many important concepts in SQL like Subqueries, Multiple joins, CTE, Window functions, etc.

2. Power BI - Visualized the extracted data using Power BI. Used different visuals like Bar Chart, Line Chart, Donut Chart etc. to clearly communicate the insights from the data.

3. MS PowerPoint - The final output of the project was a video presentation I have created in PowerPoint. I explored various features in PowerPoint to make the presentation effective. You can find]the Presentation PDF on my GitHub profile.
